# RPC-File-Transfer
A smal file transfer project using RPC C on linux that I did for college.

## Compiling
In order to compile this project, you will need to have RPC lib installed.

After installing it, just run ``make`` command inside the project folder and it will compile the code. The output files names will be ``transfer_client`` and ``transfer_server``.
